# Welcome to my Algorithm Training Ground

I use javascript primarily for the writing of my algorithms and I do it to get a solid grasp of algorithms. I have other repos that also have some algorithm practices but I have decided today to use this repo as my main repo for all algorithm related code [for fun of course lol]. 

My intention is to test these algorithms with Jest or any other testing tool but I do not have them in my inventory as at this time, so a simple ```console.log``` and inline commenting would do the trick. I will add the tests in due time as I learn and get comfortable with them.

In order to start this project, I had to go study some data structures and algorithms.
The knowledge of Binary Search Tree algorithm is a requirement for this algorithm. I used a Breath First Search and the time complexity for the project is O(n^2). I would review it with time because this is my first time trying this project.
I used both functions and classes to write the program.
